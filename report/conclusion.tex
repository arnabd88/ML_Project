\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
As mentioned in the previous sections, we do not consider the runtime of tools as a metric in our predictor. One continuation of this work is to include tool runtime as a metric to learn more accurate predictors. Also, learning on both svcomp14 and svcomp15, and cross validating the results on each other, or on the new data set of 2016 will be an extension of this work. Since we expect these predictors to improve as that will consider the variation in tools and scoring method in both 2014 and 2015 data sets.
